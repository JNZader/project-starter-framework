Create an implementation plan for: $ARGUMENTS

Process:
1. Understand the requirement — ask clarifying questions if ambiguous
2. Explore the codebase to understand current architecture and patterns
3. Identify affected files and components
4. Design the approach with trade-offs considered
5. Break down into ordered implementation steps
6. Identify risks and edge cases

Output format:
## Goal
(1-2 sentences)

## Affected Files
(list with brief description of changes)

## Implementation Steps
(numbered, ordered by dependency)

## Risks & Edge Cases
(what could go wrong)

## Testing Strategy
(how to verify the change works)

Do NOT start implementing — just plan. Ask for approval before proceeding.
