type = "prompt"
text = """
Clean up code in: $ARGUMENTS

Focus areas:
1. Fix lint/formatting issues
2. Simplify overly complex expressions
3. Improve variable/function naming for clarity
4. Remove code smells (long methods, deep nesting, magic numbers)
5. Extract constants for magic values
6. Simplify conditional logic (guard clauses, early returns)
7. Remove unnecessary comments (code should be self-documenting)

Rules:
- Do NOT change behavior — cleanup only
- Do NOT add new features or refactor architecture
- Run tests after cleanup to verify nothing broke
- Keep changes focused — one type of cleanup per commit
- Commit with: refactor: clean up <scope>
