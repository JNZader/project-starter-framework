Verify SDD implementation for: {{args}}

Validation checklist:
1. **Acceptance Criteria** — Check each criterion from the spec
2. **Test Coverage** — Verify tests exist for all specified behaviors
3. **Design Compliance** — Implementation follows the design document
4. **Edge Cases** — Scenarios from the spec are handled
5. **No Scope Creep** — Nothing was added beyond the spec
6. **No Regressions** — Existing tests still pass

Process:
1. Read the spec and design documents
2. Compare implementation against each requirement
3. Run the full test suite
4. Report: PASS/FAIL for each criterion
5. List any deviations or gaps found

Output a verification report with clear pass/fail status.
