Identify and safely remove dead code in: $ARGUMENTS

Types of dead code:
- Functions/methods never called
- Variables declared but never read
- Unreachable code branches
- Unused imports
- Feature flags always true/false
- Code after return/throw

Safe process:
1. Identify candidate code to remove
2. Search ALL usages in the codebase (exhaustive grep)
3. Verify it's not used via reflection, dynamic imports, or external config
4. Remove the code
5. Run the full test suite
6. If tests pass: commit 'refactor: remove dead code in X'

Caution: Some 'dead code' is intentional (lifecycle hooks, dynamically registered handlers). Verify before removing.
