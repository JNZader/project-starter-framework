Implement SDD tasks for: $ARGUMENTS

Process:
1. Read the task list from the current SDD change
2. For each task (in order):
   a. Read the relevant spec and design sections
   b. Implement the code changes
   c. Run tests to verify
   d. Commit with conventional commit message
3. Mark each task as completed after successful implementation

Rules:
- Follow the spec and design exactly — do not deviate
- One task = one commit (atomic changes)
- Run tests after EACH task
- If a task is blocked, report the blocker and skip to the next
- If you discover something not covered by the spec, stop and ask

Show progress after each task is completed.
