description = "Create a conventional commit from staged changes"
prompt = """
Create a git commit from the currently staged changes.

Process:
1. Run `git diff --cached` to see staged changes
2. Analyze the nature of the changes (feature, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore)
3. Draft a Conventional Commit message: type(scope): description
4. Keep subject line under 72 characters, imperative mood
5. Add body if changes are complex (blank line after subject)
6. NEVER add Co-Authored-By or AI attribution
7. Show the commit message for approval before committing

If no changes are staged, show `git status` and suggest what to stage.
