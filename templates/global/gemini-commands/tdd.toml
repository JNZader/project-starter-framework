Implement using TDD: {{args}}

Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly:

1. **RED** — Write a failing test first
   - Test the expected behavior, not implementation details
   - Run the test to confirm it FAILS (important!)

2. **GREEN** — Write the MINIMUM code to make the test pass
   - No extra features, no premature optimization
   - Run the test to confirm it PASSES

3. **REFACTOR** — Clean up while tests stay green
   - Remove duplication, improve naming, simplify
   - Run tests after each refactoring step

Repeat the cycle for each behavior/requirement.

Rules:
- Never write production code without a failing test first
- Each cycle should be small (1 behavior = 1 test = 1 cycle)
- Show the test BEFORE the implementation
- Run tests after EVERY step
