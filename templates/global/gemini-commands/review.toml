Review code changes in: {{args}}

If no path specified, review unstaged changes (`git diff`).

Review checklist:
1. **Security**: OWASP top 10, injection, XSS, secrets in code
2. **Logic**: Edge cases, off-by-one, null handling, race conditions
3. **Performance**: N+1 queries, unnecessary allocations, missing indexes
4. **Readability**: Naming, complexity, dead code, unclear intent
5. **Testing**: Missing test coverage for new/changed behavior
6. **Architecture**: SOLID violations, tight coupling, wrong abstraction level

Format: List issues by severity (critical > warning > suggestion).
For each issue: file:line, description, suggested fix.
